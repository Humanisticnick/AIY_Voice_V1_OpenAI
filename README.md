What is this?

I aimed to create a simple way for my kids to interact with 'the robot on dad's phone.' However after making it, I found I really enjoyed having one on my desk as well.

After exploring various options and contemplating building something from the ground up, I discovered the Google AIY Voice Kit, released in 2017. As of 2024, it appears that the best version of this kit for my needs is V1, which includes the 'Voice Hat' instead of the 'Voice Bonnet.'

The objective is to develop a voice assistant that has a pleasant voice, an easy-to-use interface, and is highly intelligent.

Requirements:

    Google AIY Voice Kit V1
    Raspberry Pi 3 (other models might also work, but I'm not certain)
    MicroSD Card (8GB or larger)
    Micro USB cable
    USB Power Supply (must be reliable, as Raspberry Pis are sensitive to power quality)
    An OpenAI API Key
    Another computer to SSH into the Pi
